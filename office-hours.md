# Office Hours

The Chan Zuckerberg Institute has generously funded an Xarray Community Developer position. As part of this role the current developer, Ian Hunt-Isaak, holds online office hours every other week. 

## Are office hours for you?

Yes! Anyone interested in the intersection of `Xarray` and biological scientific computing is welcome. If you have barely heard of `Xarray` and are curious about the benefits you should come. On the other end of the spectrum if you are an advanced user with a complicated question or bug you should also come.



## When and Where

The office hours occur every two weeks swapping between two different times in order to be available to a range of time zones. The meetings occur in the google meet link attached to the calendar.

## Other Options

If you are not able to make it to office hours, or if you'd feel more comfortable talking one on one you can also schedule time with Ian here:
